# PyCraftKit

Lightweight utilities and tools for working with Minecraft-related Python projects.

## Overview

PyCraftKit is a small collection of utilities focused on simplifying common tasks when working with Minecraft-related Python scripts and tooling. The primary entry point is the `pycraftkit.py` script which ships in the repository.

## Features

- Command-line configuration helper
- Small, extensible utility functions useful for Minecraft modding and tooling

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+

## Installation

Clone the repository and run directly from source:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/akw3s/PyCraftKit.git
cd pycraftkit_lib
```

Or install into an environment and run the script directly.

## Usage

Run the main script `pycraftkit.py` with the `config` command to open or edit configuration:

```powershell
python pycraftkit.py config
```

Replace `config` with other subcommands implemented in `pycraftkit.py`.

## Development

- Edit `pycraftkit.py` to add or improve commands.
- Add unit tests under a `tests/` directory and run them with your preferred test runner (e.g., `pytest`).
